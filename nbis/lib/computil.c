      Contains general purpose routines responsible for processing
      compression algorithm markers in a compressed datastream.

      ROUTINES:
#cat: biomeval_nbis_read_skip_marker_segment - skips the segment data following a
#cat:           JPEGB, JPEGL, or WSQ marker in the open filestream.
#cat: biomeval_nbis_getc_skip_marker_segment - skips the segment data following a
#cat:           JPEGB, JPEGL, or WSQ marker in the given memory buffer.
