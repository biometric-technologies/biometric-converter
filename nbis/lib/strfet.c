      Contains routines responsible for converting an attribute-value
      paired list to and from a null-terminated string.

      ROUTINES:
#cat: biomeval_nbis_fet2string - takes an FET structure and concatenates (name,value)
#cat:              pairs into a single null-terminated string with each
#cat:              (name,value) pair delimited by a new-line.
#cat: biomeval_nbis_string2fet - parses a null-terminated string representing a
#cat:              list of (name,value) pairs into an FET structure.
