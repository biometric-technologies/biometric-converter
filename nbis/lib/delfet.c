      Contains routines responsible for removing an entry from an
      attribute-value paired list.

      ROUTINES:
#cat: biomeval_nbis_deletefet - removes the specified feature entry from an fet structure.
#cat:             Exits on error.
#cat: biomeval_nbis_deletefet_ret - removes the specified feature entry from an fet
#cat:             structure.  Returns on error.
