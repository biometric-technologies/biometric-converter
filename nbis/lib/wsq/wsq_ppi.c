      LIBRARY: WSQ - Grayscale Image Compression

      FILE:    PPI.C
      AUTHORS: Craig Watson

      DATE:    01/17/2001
      UPDATED: 04/25/2005 by MDG

      Contains routines responsible for determining the scan
      resolution of a WSQ compressed image by attempting to
      locate and parse a NISTCOM comment in the datastream.

      ROUTINES:
#cat: biomeval_nbis_read_ppi_wsq - Given a WSQ compressed data stream, attempts to
#cat:                read a NISTCOM comment from an open file and
#cat:                if possible return the pixel scan resulution
#cat:                (PPI value) stored therein.
#cat: biomeval_nbis_getc_ppi_wsq - Given a WSQ compressed data stream, attempts to
#cat:                read a NISTCOM comment from a memory buffer and
#cat:                if possible return the pixel scan resulution
#cat:                (PPI value) stored therein.
